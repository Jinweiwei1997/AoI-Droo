*Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks*

This folder includs all pre-generated training and testing data set, including:

- **data_#.mat**: , where # = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30} is the number of WDs

- [data_10_WeightsAlternated.mat](data_10_WeightsAlternated.mat): The data set when all WDs' weights are alternated. It contains the same values of 'input_h' as the ones stored in [data_10.mat](data_10.mat). However, the optimal offloading mode, resource allocation, and the maximum computation rate are recalculated since WDs' weights are alternated.


## Data Format

Data samples are generated by enumerating all 2^N binary offloading actions for N <= 10 and by following the CD method presented in [2] for N = 20, 30. There are 30,000 (for N = 10, 20, 30) or 10,000 (otherwise) samples saved in each \*.mat file. Where each data sample includes:

|      variable          |    description            |
|------------------------:|:-----------------------|
|     input_h           |  The wireless channel gain between WDs and the AP   $\mathbf{h}$        |         
|     output_mode        |  The optimal binary offloading action  $\mathbf{x}^*$      |    
|      output_a           | The optimal fraction of time that the AP broadcasts RF energy for the WDs to harvest  $a^*$ |    
|    output_tau         | The optimal fraction of time allocated to WDs for task offloading $\mathbf{\tau}^*$|    
|      output_obj         | The optimal weighted sum computation rate $Q^*$   |
